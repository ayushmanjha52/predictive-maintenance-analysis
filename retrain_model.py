"""
Retraining Pipeline for Combi Mill PdM Model
Run this script whenever you have new delay data to update the model.

FIXES vs. previous version -- both confirmed with real data:

1. CRITICAL: used a random train_test_split(test_size=0.20) to evaluate
   the retrained model. Confirmed on this data: this reports 83.6%
   "accuracy" vs. the honest ~62-65% established repeatedly elsewhere in
   this project via proper time-based holdout (train on all-but-latest
   month, test only on that unseen month). A random split shuffles
   similar-phrased delays from every month together, the same way
   k-fold CV did earlier -- it flatters the number without telling you
   anything about performance on a genuinely new future month.

2. CRITICAL: reimplemented its own training logic from scratch (fixed
   RandomForest hyperparameters, no model comparison, no compound-label
   collapsing) instead of reusing train.py's actual methodology. This
   meant every retrain would SILENTLY REPLACE whatever model
   train.py's rigorous comparison had selected as the genuine best
   (currently Logistic Regression, per training_manifest.json) with a
   plain, untuned Random Forest -- using an inflated accuracy number as
   false reassurance that this was an improvement.

3. Never touched training_manifest.json, so after running this script,
   the manifest (which app.py's /model_info reads) would describe a
   model that's no longer actually deployed -- reintroducing the exact
   "stale metadata" bug fixed in app.py earlier this session, via a
   completely different code path.

FIX: this is now a thin wrapper around train.py's train_and_evaluate(),
which already does model comparison + compound-label collapsing + honest
holdout selection + manifest writing correctly. Retraining should mean
"re-run the same rigorous process on updated data," never a separate,
looser process. This script adds ONLY two things on top: timestamped
version snapshots (for rollback/audit) and a regression guard that
refuses to silently keep a new model that's WORSE than what's currently
deployed, on the metric that actually matters (honest holdout accuracy).
